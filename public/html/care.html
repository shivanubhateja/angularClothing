            <p class="big">The OC Tees are built to last. Treat it with care, and a single tee will look great for years. Here's how you do it -</p>

            <h3>Gentle, Cold Wash</h3>
            <p class="small">
             Cotton shrinks quickly in hot water. Hand wash your March Tee in cold water or use the delicate cycle on your machine.
            </p>


            <h3>Dry in Shade</h3>
            <p class="small">
             Sunlight dulls dyes that are used to color cotton. Line dry your March Tee in the shade, or tumble dry it on low.
            </p>


            <h3>Warm Iron</h3>
            <p class="small">
Cotton can easily get scorched under a hot iron. Always iron your March Tee on low to medium heat.
            </p>


            <h3>No Dry Cleaning</h3>
            <p class="small">
             Chemicals are harsh on cotton fabrics. Bleaching and dry cleaning are bad for the planet and too intense for your March Tee. Just stick to the basics.
