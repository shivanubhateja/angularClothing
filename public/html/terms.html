          <p class="small">We reserve the right to refuse orders you place with us. This could be due to limited inventory, lack of logistics support in your location or payment issues raised from our payment gateway providers. </p>
          <p class="small">You agree to provide current, complete and accurate purchase and account information for all purchases made at our store.</p>
          
          <h3>Pricing</h3>
          <p class="small">We price our products with a lot of thought and rarely change them. In occasions when we need to, we reserve the right to update our product prices and discontinue them based on our own discretion. When we update a products price, this website will clearly reflect the current price of the product. Discontinued products may no longer appear on the website.</p>
          
      
          <h3>Delivery and Shipping</h3>

          <h3>Gift card and Referrals</h3>
          <p class="small">A gift card may be issued or purchased only directly from us. The recipient will receive an email notification containing a unique code.
